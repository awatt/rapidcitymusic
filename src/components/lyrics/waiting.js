				WAITING<br />
				<br />
				the storm door opens - like a giant’s hand<br />
				our silent footfalls - frozen in the sand<br />
				working boats roll shoreward - a team of tired sprinters<br />
				summer town is zipping up its jacket for the winter<br />
				<br />
				and I’m waiting for your eyes to open<br />
				like a curtain on a stage<br />
				the bird will sing when it<br />
				flees the cage and<br />
				<br />
				one day this black spell will be broken<br />
				and the waiting will be done<br />
				the more that I can see your face<br />
				the more like you I that become<br />
				<br />
				abandoned sawmill - shattered glass and beams<br />
				gutted and seeded with a hundred silver screens<br />
				beyond the pixels - a shining new frontier<br />
				we hunt for life forms that we never could find here<br />
				<br />
				and we’re waiting for your eyes to open<br />
				like the curtain on a stage<br />
				an open the book on a<br />
				tattered page and<br />
				<br />
				one day this black spell will be broken<br />
				and the waiting will be done<br />
				and we shall see what<br />
				you’ve become and<br />
				<br />
				there will be mountains and deep valleys<br />
				never be another choice<br />
				the straightaways are short and sweet<br />
				lead us to them with your voice<br />
				<br />
