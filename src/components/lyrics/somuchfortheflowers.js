				SO MUCH FOR THE FLOWERS<br/>
				<br/>
				don’t fall asleep, you’ll overshoot the beltway<br/>
				(dirty city, this dirty town)<br/>
				and if you waver from the plan on retribution day<br/>   
				(hell to pay, there’ll be hell to pay)<br/>
				the motor inn provides the perfect cover<br/>
				(get the one with the mini-bar)<br/>
				out of the wilderness we go!<br/>
				<br/>
				don’t play the victim, you don’t wanna go there<br/>
				(no you didn’t, oh no you don’t)<br/>
				you will just get eaten by an even bigger bear<br/>
				(precious honey is what they love)<br/>
				what is that smell?  son, that’s the future burning.<br/>
				(this is what we’ve been waiting for)<br/>
				we’re killing commies with a phone!<br/>
				<br/>
				so much for the flowers<br/>
				so much for the candles<br/>
				it always comes down to<br/>
				what God and Beauty can’t handle<br/>
				<br/>
				now you’ve got a finger<br/>
				and we’ve got a trigger<br/>
				if we bring them together<br/>
				we can make this place much bigger<br/>
				<br/>
				it don’t make a sound, the voice is like a feeling<br/>
				(talk too much, yeah you talk too much)<br/>
				it’s the candlelight that’s dancing on the ceiling<br/>
				(in the body, it’s in the blood)<br/>
				our boys can sing an old man’s song!<br/>
				<br/>
				so much for the flowers<br/>
				so much for the candles<br/>
				it always comes down to<br/>
				what God and Beauty can’t handle<br/>
				<br/>
				oh captain, my captain<br/>
				teach me how to use this contraption<br/>
				we know where they’re hiding<br/>
				aluminum siding<br/>
				<br />
