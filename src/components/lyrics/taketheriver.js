				TAKE THE RIVER<br />
				<br />
				it’s growing outward like a leaf<br />
				it’s sprouting legs and hands and teeth<br />
				this morning violent and free<br />
				I see your map & you want to drive<br />
				<br />
				away with my pride<br />
				never ever to be seen by the naked eye<br />
				<br />
				over that hill<br />
				never you find<br />
				never ever to be seen by the naked eye<br />
				<br />
				but, I’ll take the river<br />
				dance on the knife of purity<br />
				ache, shake and shiver<br />
				the river brings the love to me<br />
				<br />
				don’t need a microscope to read<br />
				the fingerprints of history<br />
				there’s a chromosome that built a ship<br />
				and now I live inside of it<br />
				I know a place where we can meet<br />
				I’ll mark the map to where you must drive<br />
				<br />
				away with your pride<br />
				never ever to be seen by the naked eye<br />
				<br />
				over that hill<br />
				never you find<br />
				never ever to be seen by the naked eye<br />
				<br />
				just take the river<br />
				dance on the knife of purity<br />
				ache, shake and shiver<br />
				a prayer that opens to the sea<br />
				<br />
				not going with them<br />
				to fade into a litany<br />
				we’ll take the river<br />
				where there’s no choice but to be free<br />
				<br />
				just take the river….<br />
