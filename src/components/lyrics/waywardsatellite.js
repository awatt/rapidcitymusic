					WAYWARD SATELLITE<br/>
					<br/>
					five miles from all the half smiles<br/>
					stands our happy little home<br/>
					and seasons give us reasons<br/>
					like a metronome<br/>
					like a metronome<br/>
					so how could you feel so lonely<br/>
					when you are never alone?<br/>
					<br/>
					well, I don’t know why<br/>
					but I had to go and<br/>
					take the bus to<br/>
					north of Portland<br/>
					<br/>
					I feel there’s something<br/>
					or someone missing<br/>
					so I’ll be running these crooked circles<br/>
					like a wayward satellite<br/>
					till I find a home<br/>
					<br/>
					these walls smell like moth balls<br/>
					from well before your birth<br/>
					and bones that gave you your bones<br/>
					vibrate in the earth<br/>
					so we pray for your safe return<br/>
					for whatever that’s worth<br/>
					<br/>
					the night sings in colored lightnings<br/>
					blue and gold and grey<br/>
					the voices in these frozen hills<br/>
					have said all they will say<br/>
					so I paid another bus to<br/>
					push those hills away<br/>
					<br/>
					my little cherub<br/>
					my little charmer<br/>
					will you help me off with<br/>
					this body armor?<br/>
					<br/>
					well, I had a good time<br/>
					think I hit the mother lode<br/>
					finally found my doppelganger<br/>
					where I left him by the side<br/>
					of a crooked road<br/>
					<br />
