				HEART’S TOOTH<br />
				<br />
				who climbed the willow with me?<br />
				kingdom as far as the<br />
				naked eye sees<br />
				balcony<br />
				<br />
				who ruled the white woods as one?<br />
				we got our strength from the sun<br />
				the lonely old sun<br />
				pendulum<br />
				<br />
				are you going back to the old house?<br />
				are you wiping the dust from the blinds?<br />
				<br />
				can you see those kids and the places they hid?<br /> 
				are they laughing the air from their minds?<br />
				<br />
				there’s a moon-faced girl as shy as a bird<br />
				please remind her of me if you can.<br />
				<br />
				you’ve got a heart’s tooth and a fountain of youth<br />
				and you’ll never come this way again.<br />
				<br />
				two shadows run down the street<br />
				two shadows stick to our feet<br />
				small and neat<br />
				incomplete<br />
				<br />
				who tore the hole in your clothes?<br />
				who left your blood on the rose?<br />
				thorn exposed<br />
				decompose<br />
				<br />
				are you going back to the old house?<br />
				are you wearing a crown of black flies?<br />
				<br />
				is the air up there still colder than snow<br />
				does the water still freeze in your eyes?<br />
				<br />
				there are vacancies at the hotel of dreams<br />
				there are lives that are waiting unlived<br />
				<br />
				you’ve got a heart’s tooth and a fountain of youth<br />
				waging war on our dead narratives<br />
				<br />
