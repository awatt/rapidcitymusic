				RIVULETS<br />
				<br />
				travel lightly, turning slightly blue<br />
				just like a pilgrim’s supposed to do<br />
				sweet contagion, Appalachian flu<br />
				has got its hooks inside of you<br />
				<br />
				but only red, red rivulets get through<br />
				rolling over leaves and rocks and roots<br />
				through the muscled mountains to the truth<br />
				it’s the blood that’s speaking through our boots<br />
				<br />
				with ageless rhythm, catechism<br />
				a line of temples falling down<br />
				<br />
				poison weather, English leather shoes<br />
				beating a path I did not choose<br />
				“take my hand you clever man”, she said<br />
				and wiped a hailstone from my head<br />
				<br />
				but only red, red rivulets can roam<br />
				when they leave our bodies here alone<br />
				and wherever she stands, stands my home<br />
				she’s a lullaby that I intone<br />
				<br />
				with ageless rhythm, catechism<br />
				in this old temple falling down<br />
				<br />
