				Eva has a question for the man<br/>
				"in all your travels when the roads turned to gravel<br/>
				did you turn and go back home?"<br/>
				<br/>
				and maybe she could ask you one more thing<br/>
				"if you found religion in feeding pigeons,<br/>
				what do you do when they all fly away?"<br/>
				<br/>
				and "whats the point of all this struggle<br/>
				to try to find yourself another,<br/>
				when there’s so much to be missed<br/>
				and there’s no loneliness like<br/>
				the loneliness of a lover?"<br/>
				<br/>
				another day another dollar down<br/>
				her education taught delayed gratification,<br/>
				but was silent on how long to delay<br/>
				<br/>
				and what about these things that she’s acquired,<br/>
				are they extensions of her best intentions<br/>
				or do they just distract her<br/>
				from what she'd rather not see?<br/>
				<br/>
				"and what’s the point of all this struggle<br/>
				to try to find yourself another,<br/>
				when I always find my bliss<br/>
				and there’s no loneliness like<br/>
				the loneliness of a lover?"<br/>
