				ALL IS REAL<br />
				<br />
				today your voice sounds like the evening <br />
				and your words are like the dawn<br />
				but I wish more people did their grieving<br />
				in the form of peasant songs<br />
				<br />
				and so I float like a flake<br />
				to lay my head on a frozen lake<br />
				you trickle by through the field<br />
				we thaw into whatever you feel<br />
				<br />
				all is real<br />
				<br />
				I try to get all my mistakes in,<br />
				while my friends are out of town<br />
				but if a tree falls in the city,<br />
				does really it make a sound?<br />
				<br />
				the more I drink, the less I read<br />
				like trying to un-plant a seed<br />
				you trickle by in early spring<br />
				weâ€™re thawing through the openings<br />
				<br />
				of real things<br />
				<br/>
